etframes: Applying the ideas of Edward Tufte to matplotlib
==============

[Edward Tufte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_tufte) is a
professor and author known for his excellent (and beautiful!) books on
the visual display of statistical information.  Last year I had the
opportunity to attend one of his
[courses](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses) and was inspired
to apply his ideas to my favorite plotting library,
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/).

The result is [etfames](http://hupp.org/adam/svn/public/etframes), a
python module that operates on matplotlib plots.  So far I've
implemented two graph types described in the [The Visual Display of
Quantitative Information
(VDQI)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FVisual-Display-Quantitative-Information-2nd%2Fdp%2F0961392142%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1188758757%26sr%3D8-1&tag=rococothenrub-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325):
the dash-dot-plot and range frames.

Dash Dot Plot
-------------

A dash-dot-plot places a tick mark on the axis for each value in a
scatter plot.  When there are many values in the graph this can be a
more effective way to understand their distribution than looking at
the raw data.  For example:

![Example of a dash dot plot]("http://hupp.org//adam/images/ddp.png")

See [demo_ddp.py](http://github.com/ahupp/etframes/blob/master/demo_ddp.py)
for a working example.

Range Frames
-------------

The range frame re-uses the frame (edge) of a graph to display useful
information.  Instead of drawing a full frame around the graph the
frame is only drawn from the minimum to the maximum value along that
axis.  For example:

![Example of a range frame]("http://hupp.org/adam/images/range.png")

See [demo_range.py](http://github.com/ahupp/etframes/blob/master/demo_range.py)
for a working example.

Other Work
------------

There are several other graph types described in VDQI that would be
nice to implement, particularly the extension of range frames that
turns them into a [box plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot).

A related project is [sparkplot](http://sparkplot.org/) which uses the
matplotlib library to create sparklines.
